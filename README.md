This repository provides a simple implementation of a **Queue data structure** using linked lists in C++. It supports standard queue operations such as:

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the back of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front.
- **Display**: Show all elements currently in the queue.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkalam/Queue.git
   cd Queue
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ test.cpp -o queue
   ```

3. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./queue
   ```

### Example Usage
The code demonstrates enqueuing and dequeuing elements, with an example input of integers `10`, `20`, and `30`. The output shows the initial queue, the value dequeued, and the final state of the queue.

## Features
- Dynamic memory allocation using linked list nodes.
- Handles basic queue operations efficiently.
- Ensures safe element removal with memory cleanup.
